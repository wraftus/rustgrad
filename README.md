# rustgrad
A simple and (hopefully) light-weight [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) system implemented in Rust.

[karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and [geohot/tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) are neat and inspired this project.
